1. Put the folder this Readme.txt is in into your server's garrysmod/gamemodes directory.

Plea from the creators:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please don't totally fuck over our gamemode with shitty guns and roleplay bullshit.

The last thing we want to see in the server list is:
"RPcunts.fuck - Serious Stronghold Role-play | [MONEYPRINTERS][FURSUITS][DILDOGUNS][STUPIDBULLSHIT]".
"[FAGS] Stronghold fixed weapons with shitty muzzle heat wave effects and unmanagable unrealistic recoil bullshit"

We put a lot of work into making the game balanced. So, don't do any of that. Thank you.
